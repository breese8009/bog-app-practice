# REFLECTION

-The first 2 times I found myself basically copy and pasting from the instructions and running into problems. By the 3rd time, I REALLY started to understand what I was doing and going about it on my own. 4th Time I only went back for a couple of the set up steps and the rest I was able to go through on my own as far as the routes, controllers and html.erb's. I also watch A LOT of tutotials all weekend and have a much better understanding of rails.


# TIPS

-Don't over think all the files, their not that bad once you get into it.

-The routes are the same as express/node, just diff syntax


# BEST TIME

- My best time was 47 minutes, with minimal help from documentation
